# Mystery Tracker
Mystery Tracker reads in a large dataset from a JSON file detailing when various sensors were activated,
what event occurred, and who activated it (among other data). It then groups the data into its individual 
sensor events and displays it in a list, which can be easily sorted by guest, event, time, etc with a click of a button. 
By selecting any data point, it will also be shown on a floor plan of the hotel and described in plain English. This way,
non-technical people such as the police can easily interpret the data.
